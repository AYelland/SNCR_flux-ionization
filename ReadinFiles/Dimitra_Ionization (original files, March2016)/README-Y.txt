This table consisting of general purpose ionization data (merged-Y.txt)
â€”

This tables gives the atmospheric ionization profile of cosmic ray induced protons in the atmosphere. The table is formatted in 59 columns, each for a particular primary energy in GeV (ranging from 300 MeV to 1 PeV) and 21 rows, each with bin size 50 g/cm2 (ranging from 0 to 1036 g/cm2). Numbers in the table correspond to ion pairs produced in the atmosphere. First calculate the number of particles in a given energy bin using your spectrum. One must then multiply the number of particles obtained from the spectrum to obtain the number of ion pairs produced (Ion Pairs sr cm2 g-1 s-1) for that given bin.

NOTE: To find the primary kinetic energy for a particular proton primary use the relation: K = (E^2 - m^2)/2m ; where K is the kinetic energy, E is the total energy, and m is the mass of the proton.
